# Answering Business Questions Using SQL
***
## Introduction

The aim of this project is to explore a modified version of the [Chinook](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) database using SQL and answer some business questions. The Chinook database represents a fictional digital media shop, based on real data from an iTunes Library and manually generated data. The database is provided as a SQLite database file called `chinook.db`.

<i>Scenario</i>
<p>The Chinook record store has just signed a deal with a new record label, and you've been tasked with selecting the first three albums that will be added to the store, from a list of four. All four albums are by artists that don't have any tracks in the store right now.</p>

<p>The record label specializes in artists from the USA, and they have given Chinook some money to advertise the new albums in the USA, so we're interested in finding out which genres sell the best in the USA.</p>

<p>We have been tasked with:</p>

* Determine which Album/Tracks Should be Purchased
* Find the Best Performing Sales Agent
* Analyze the Sales Data for Customers from Each Country
* Determine if the Store Should Purchase Whole Albums or Individual Tracks
* Which Artist is Used in the Most Playlists?
* How Many Tracks Have Been Purchased vs Not Purchased?
* Is the Range of Tracks in the Store Reflective of their Sales Popularity?
* Do Protected vs Non-Protected Media Types Have an Effect on Popularity?
